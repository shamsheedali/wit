      <p>
        Welcome to Wit — Where Chess Meets Community. Wit is more than just an
        online chess board. It’s a place where players of all levels come to
        challenge themselves, connect with others, and grow their game. Whether
        you’re looking to play a quick match against a bot, invite a friend for
        a friendly duel, or dive into competitive tournaments, Wit is built to
        make every move meaningful. We created Wit with a simple idea: chess
        should be fun, accessible, and social. That’s why we’ve loaded the
        platform with features that make it easy to play, learn, and engage —
        like: Play vs Bot: Practice your skills against AI of different levels.
        Play vs Friends: Send an invite and challenge your mates instantly. Play
        Online: Match up with players from around the world. Tournaments: Join
        or host competitive events and test your strategy. Chess Clubs &
        Discussions: Connect with like-minded players, share insights, and geek
        out over game analysis. Leaderboards: See how you stack up and climb the
        ranks. At Wit, we believe chess is not just a game — it’s a language, a
        culture, a community. Whether you&apos;re a seasoned player or just getting
        started, there’s a seat at the table for you. Let’s play smart. Let’s
        play with Wit.
